# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
    > I feel that the python programming language is similar to java, but is a lot more optimized in smaller ways. I think that this can be seen with the lack of semi-colons, not needing to declare your variable type, and easier ways of writing conditionals and loops that make more complex problems easier. I feel like I still need to get used to programming in python and fully understanding how to use it to its fullest potential but overall I think I have a lot of hope and enthusiasm for learning this programming language.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
  > I really only have experience in Java, but I feel like python is very similar with the use of if and else statements aswell as for and while loops. Also writing methods felt very similar but I personally perfer python's use of indentation instead of the use of curly brackets which I feel like can get very cluttered.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
 > I feel like the most important thing I learned through this assignment is how to translate my problem solving through python. Oftentimes when I was working through the problems my mindset stayed the same as it would in java, but I would have difficulties translating it into python. Towards the end of the problems, I was using python features to do things that I otherwise couldn't do as easily in java. Using ChatGPT also helped me through some of the difficulties and intricies of the language, such as where arrays start or what methods strings have. Using AI to agreggate large amounts of data that would take an extended amount to gather. Instead, I was able to ask the AI and within a few moments I got my answer, I was also able to ask the AI to elaborate or change some things to further facilitate my learning environment.
